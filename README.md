# Simplang to Assembly Compiler

## Project Description
This project is a C++ compiler that translates Simplang, a simple programming language, into assembly code designed for an 8-bit computer. The compiler is organized into several key components:

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes Simplang source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Parser**: Analyzes the tokenized input to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Code Generator**: Converts the AST into assembly instructions tailored for an 8-bit computer.
- **Optimizer**: (Optional) Refines the assembly code to enhance performance and efficiency.

The compiler demonstrates how high-level language constructs can be systematically translated into low-level assembly instructions executable by an 8-bit computer.

## Features
- **Lexer**: Performs lexical analysis to tokenize Simplang code.
- **Parser**: Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokenized input.
- **Code Generator**: Converts the AST into assembly code.
- **8-bit Computer Instructions**: Supports a defined set of instructions for 8-bit architecture.
- **Optimization**: (Optional) Enhances assembly code for better performance.

## Project Structure
The project directory contains:

- `src/`: Source code for the compiler.
- `src/headers/`
  - `lexer.hpp`: Lexer implementation.
  - `parser.hpp`: Parser implementation.
  - `genarate.hpp`: Code generator implementation.

- `simplang.cpp`: Main file for Simplang compiler logic.
- `src/algolims/`
  - `inFixPostion.cpp`: Implements infix-to-postfix conversion algorithm.
- `tests/`: Unit tests and test cases.
- `examples/`: Sample Simplang code (`example.smpl`) and expected assembly outputs.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Installation
To build and run the compiler, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hardik8491/SImplangCpp_Compailer.git
   cd SImplangCpp_Compailer

## Build && RUN
To build and run the compiler, follow these steps:
   ```bash
 cd "[Your Complailer Path]" ; if ($?) { g++ simpleLang.cpp -o simpleLang } ; if ($?) { .\simpleLang [your example file] }
```
Here's the formatted markdown for your `Usage` section, including code blocks and examples:

## Usage
To compile Simplang code, use the following command:

```bash
./simplang-compiler input.simplang
```

Replace `input.simplang` with the path to your Simplang source file. The output will be an assembly code file suitable for execution on an 8-bit computer.

## Example

Here is an example of Simplang code and its corresponding assembly output:

**Simplang Code (example.smpl):**

```simplang
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    return a + b;
}
```

**Generated Assembly Code (example.asm):**

```assembly
; Example Assembly Code
LOAD 5
STORE A
LOAD 10
STORE B
LOAD A
ADD B
STORE RESULT
HALT
```

## 8-bit Instruction Set

The assembly code generated by the compiler uses the following 8-bit instructions:

- `LOAD <value>`: Load an immediate value into a register.
- `STORE <register>`: Store the value from a register into memory.
- `ADD <register>`: Add the value of a register to the accumulator.
- `HALT`: Stop execution.
